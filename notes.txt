1. Understand the App's Purpose and Features
   What basic functionality will the app have?
      - Add, edit, and delete tasks.
      - Mark tasks as complete.
      - Filter tasks (e.g., active, completed).
    Will you include advanced features?
      - Due dates.
      - Task categories.
      - Drag-and-drop for task reordering.
      - User authentication for saving tasks.

2. Break It Down Into Modules
   Identify core components or modules:
      UI/UX Design: Plan layouts using wireframes or mockups.
      Task Management: Handle adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
      Data Storage: Decide whether to store tasks in local storage, IndexedDB, or connect to a backend API.
      State Management: Use JavaScript to manage the task list dynamically.

3. Choose the Technology Stack
   Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   Backend (optional): If you want user accounts, use Node.js with Express.js.
   Database (optional): Use a database like MongoDB or Firebase for storing tasks.

4. Decide on Tools and Frameworks
   Will you use libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js, or Vanilla JavaScript)?
   CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or custom styling?
   Dev Tools: Git for version control, VS Code for coding.

5. Create a Detailed Plan
   List each feature as a user story, e.g.:
      "As a user, I want to add tasks so I can manage my to-do list."
      "As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete to track progress."
   Map these features to modules and tasks.

6. Sketch Out the UI
Use a tool like Figma or simple pen-and-paper to design the user interface. Focus on user experience and ease of navigation.

7. Start Small
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

A simple list where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
Store the tasks in local storage to start.
